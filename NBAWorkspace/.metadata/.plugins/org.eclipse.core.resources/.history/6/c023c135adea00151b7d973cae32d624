Feature: Advantage Categories Relative Performance Widget

# Background:
#   Given Browser Initialization

Scenario: I look for performance columns in Advantage/Categories
	Given User is on login page
	And User login with "nba_user" and "nba_password"
	And URL should contain "dashboard/hyatt"
	When User clicks on "Advantage_link"
	And User clicks on "Categories_link"
	Then "Relative_Performance_Widget" should be present
